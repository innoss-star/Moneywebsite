     <i><b>4. Dropshipping</b></i><br>

Dropshipping can help you make money for your website by enabling you to sell products without the need for inventory.<br> By partnering with a dropshipping supplier, you can sell products directly to your audience, while the supplier handles the storage, packaging and shipping of the items.<br> When a customer makes a purchase through your website, you simply forward the order details to your supplier, who then ships the product directly to the customer.<br> You earn a profit on the difference between the retail price you set and the wholesale price charged by the supplier. Dropshipping allows you to offer a wide range of products to your audience without the risk and overhead of traditional inventory management, making it an attractive option if you’re looking to get started with e-commerce or expand how you make money with your website.
